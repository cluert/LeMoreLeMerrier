WINDA: I would so love to own my own shop, but the overhead is simply outrageous. And on top of that, I'm in graduate school!	
  #choose You really are an example of how the high-achieving modern sorceress can "have it all," aren't you?
    #goto PassedFirst
    WINDA: High-achieving? Oh, I don't know if I would go THAT far. Really, I'm barely out of Pigfarts.

  #choose Sounds exhausting. Wouldn't you rather quit and work for me?
    #goto Rejected
    WINDA: As, what, exactly? I don't have time to interview, but thanks anyways!

WINDA: Do you really think I could own my own shop? I don't know... 	
  #choose Well, you could own a physical shop and have all that expense... or you could work from your own home and make passive income! Have you heard of "Fairy Dust Supplements?"
    #goto PassedSecond
    WINDA: Work from home? What sort of passive income? If it wouldn't take too much time, I suppose...

  #choose You never know what you can manifest into being! Just try these "Fairy Dust Supplements!"
    #goto Rejected
    WINDA: Oh, we aren't taught "Manifestations" until the second semester.



#label PassedSecond
WINDA: How exactly could working from home mean I become a success? And what are "Fairy Dust Supplements?"	
  #choose "Fairy Dust Supplements" are the ultimate in abundance manifesting. Just think happy thoughts!
    #goto Rejected
    WINDA: But I work in retail. I don't HAVE happy thoughts!

  #choose Selling "Fairy Dust Supplements" are the easiest way to build passive income on the side while working toward your future. Why, I could even see you featured in "Magic, Entertainment & Design" by this time next year!
    #goto Recruited
    WINDA: ... my own MED Talk? Really, do you think so? That would be amazing... 

  #choose Look, "Fairy Dust Supplements" depend on belief. You have to just... believe me, okay?
    #goto Rejected
    WINDA: Um... I think it's time you see your way out.
